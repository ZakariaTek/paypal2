You're right! "Never give up" is a great attitude to have, especially when facing challenges or pursuing goals. 
Persistence and perseverance are key qualities that can help us overcome obstacles, learn from failures, and ultimately achieve success.
However, it's also important to remember that sometimes giving up on a certain approach or goal can be the best decision for our mental health, 
well-being, and overall success. Sometimes we need to pivot, adapt, or move on to something else that better aligns with our values, passions, or abilities.

In the end, it's all about finding a balance between determination and flexibility, and being willing to learn and grow from our experiences along the way.
